First, you’ll build intuition for model-to-problem fit. Which models are robust to missing data? Which models handle categorical features well? Yes, you can dig through textbooks to find the answers, but you’ll learn better by seeing it in action.

Second, this project will show you the invaluable skill of prototyping models quickly. In the real world, it’s often difficult to know which model will perform best without simply trying them.

Finally, this exercise helps you master the workflow of model building. For example, you’ll get to practice…

Importing data
Cleaning data
Splitting it into train/test or cross-validation sets
Pre-processing
Transformations
Feature engineering
